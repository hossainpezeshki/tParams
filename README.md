## Overview 
We noticed that `tFit{fBasics}` was not working quite right,
and wrote some code for estimating the parameters of a location-scale-t-distribution 
model.

## R code
The accompanying file tdistparams.R is standalone R code
that implements what is in the document, and test_tdistparams.R 
is a short program for testing the former.
